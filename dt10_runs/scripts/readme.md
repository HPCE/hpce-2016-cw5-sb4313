These are the scripts I'm using for auto-tests,
as requested in an issue, though I'm not sure how
much they help.

They are a bit of a mess, which is why I generally
try to watch them while they run.

The main entry point is `full_run.sh`. It takes
a list of logins from the file `inputs.csv`.
